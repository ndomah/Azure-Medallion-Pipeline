# Azure Medallion Architecture: An End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement a complete data engineering pipeline using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) within **Azure Databricks**. It integrates several Azure services and **dbt (Data Build Tool)** to orchestrate data ingestion, transformation, and storage, ensuring a robust, scalable, and secure solution.

## Architecture at a Glance

1. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data)**
   - Ingests data from various sources (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis, CSV files).
   - Stores data in its raw form in **Azure Data Lake**.

2. **Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed Data)**
   - Cleanses and standardizes raw data in **Azure Databricks**.
   - Ensures data quality and consistency.

3. **Gold Layer (Aggregated & Business-Level Data)**
   - Aggregates and curates data for analytics, reporting, and machine learning.
   - Publishes business-ready datasets in **Azure Data Lake** or relational stores.

|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure**               | Primary cloud platform providing a scalable environment for data operations.                                                                                                 |
| **Azure SQL**           | Cloud-based relational database (SQL Server). We use the **AdventureWorks LT** sample database for demonstration.                                                             |
| **Azure Data Lake**     | Central repository for large-scale data storage and analytics. Stores raw, intermediate, and final datasets.                                                                  |
| **Azure Key Vault**     | Securely stores and manages sensitive information like keys, secrets, and certificates.                                                                                       |
| **Azure Databricks**    | Apache Spark-based analytics service for big data processing and machine learning. Handles complex transformations and analysis tasks.                                        |
| **Azure Data Factory**  | Orchestrates and automates data movement and transformations. Facilitates data flow between Azure services and external sources.                                             |
| **dbt (Data Build Tool)** | Streamlines data transformations using SQL. Enables modeling, testing, and documenting data transformations within the pipeline.                                            |


## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**  
   - Use **Azure Data Factory** pipelines to pull data from on-prem or external sources (e.g., CSV, JSON, APIs) into the **Bronze** layer in **Azure Data Lake**.

2. **Transformation**  
   - **Azure Databricks** notebooks or jobs process raw data into conformed datasets (the **Silver** layer).  
   - **dbt** further refines and tests these datasets, ensuring consistent transformations and business logic.

3. **Aggregation & Delivery**  
   - Final business aggregates and curated datasets (the **Gold** layer) are stored in **Azure Data Lake** and/or **Azure SQL** for reporting and analytics.  
   - Data can be consumed by BI tools (e.g., Power BI), machine learning models, or downstream applications.

4. **Orchestration & Scheduling**  
   - **Azure Data Factory** orchestrates the end-to-end process, triggering Databricks jobs, dbt transformations, and data movement tasks at scheduled intervals or based on events.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Azure Subscription** with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.  
2. **Azure Databricks Workspace**.  
3. **Azure Data Factory** instance.  
4. **Azure Data Lake Storage** (Gen2).  
5. **Azure SQL** database (using **AdventureWorks LT** sample data).  
6. **Azure Key Vault** for secret management.  
7. **dbt CLI** installed locally (or use a container-based approach) and configured to connect to your Azure environment.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Provision Resources**  
   - Create an Azure Resource Group.  
   - Provision **Azure Data Lake** (Gen2), **Azure SQL** Database, **Azure Key Vault**, **Azure Databricks**, and **Azure Data Factory**.

2. **Configure Azure Key Vault**  
   - Store connection strings, database credentials, and other secrets in **Azure Key Vault**.  
   - Grant access to Data Factory and Databricks so they can retrieve these secrets securely.

3. **Set Up Azure Databricks**  
   - Create clusters in Azure Databricks for Spark jobs.  
   - Set up notebooks or jobs to read from the Bronze layer (Data Lake) and write to the Silver and Gold layers.

4. **Install and Configure dbt**  
   - Initialize a new dbt project.  
   - Configure **profiles.yml** to connect to **Azure SQL** (and optionally your Data Lake, if needed).  
   - Write models (SQL files) to transform data in the Silver and Gold layers.  
   - Use dbt’s built-in testing to ensure data quality and consistency.

5. **Build Azure Data Factory Pipelines**  
   - **Ingestion Pipelines**: Copy raw data into the **Bronze** layer.  
   - **Transformation Pipelines**: Trigger Databricks notebooks or dbt runs to process and refine data into the **Silver** and **Gold** layers.  
   - **Scheduling & Monitoring**: Set up triggers (scheduled or event-based) and monitor pipeline runs.

6. **Validate End-to-End Workflow**  
   - Ensure that data flows from source to Bronze (raw), then to Silver (cleaned), and finally to Gold (aggregated).  
   - Check logs and alerts in **Azure Data Factory** and **Azure Databricks**.

7. **Consume & Visualize**  
   - Connect BI tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) to the **Gold** datasets.  
   - Explore and analyze data in **Azure SQL** or **Azure Databricks**.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Security**: Leverage **Azure Key Vault** to store credentials and secrets. Avoid storing sensitive information in code or config files.  
- **Scalability**: Use **Auto-scaling** features in Azure Databricks to handle variable workloads.  
- **Observability**: Implement logging and monitoring at each stage. Azure Data Factory and Databricks provide native monitoring and logging tools.  
- **Testing & Version Control**: Use dbt tests and maintain transformations in version control (e.g., GitHub) for collaboration and rollback.  
- **Cost Management**: Monitor resource usage in Azure to optimize cost. Shut down clusters when not in use.


## Conclusion
By combining the **Medallion Architecture** with **Azure** services and **dbt**, this project showcases a robust framework for **end-to-end data engineering**. It ensures data is ingested, processed, and delivered in a structured manner—enhancing data quality, scalability, and security. This approach can be extended or adapted to fit a variety of enterprise data scenarios, serving as a template for modern data pipelines.
